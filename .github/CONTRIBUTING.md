## How to contribute to FundRequest

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability
  in FundRequest**, and instead send a mail to info@fundrequest.io

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/FundRequest/platform/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/FundRequest/platform/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.




#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

* Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:
~~~~
    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
~~~~

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of FundRequest will generally not be accepted.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change in a new GitHub [issue](https://github.com/FundRequest/platform/issues)


#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question about how to use FundRequest in our [slack](https://fundrequest.slack.com) channel ([sign up](https://slack.fundrequest.io))
