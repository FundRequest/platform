### Install Git
If you don't have Git installed, you will need to this in order to build:
https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git

Make sure the git binary is on $PATH.

### Install Node
If you do not have Node installed, please install the latest LTS release:
https://nodejs.org/en/

### Install java
You need **Java 8** to run the platform. Please download and install from here:
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html 


Make sure you set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable: http://www.baeldung.com/java-home-on-windows-7-8-10-mac-os-x-linux

### Fork and Clone the repository
Fork the repository, to afterwards clone it to a local directory

### Run dependencies
FundRequest has several dependencies to run locally:
- Database (MariaDB)
- Message broker (RabbitMQ)
- Azrael (Solution from FundRequest to abstract blockchain related transactions)

You can run these dependencies using Docker: https://www.docker.com/community-edition

**To start the dependencies, go inside the cloned repository and execute `runDependencies.sh`.**

### Configure application properties
Copy `tweb/src/main/resources/application-credentials.properties.template` to `tweb/src/main/resources/application-credentials.properties` and edit properties:

```
feign.client.github.username=<your github username>

#create a developer access token on github: https://github.com/settings/tokens
feign.client.github.password=<your github token>

local.ethereum.kovan.address=<your ethereum address>

```

* To acquire Kovan ETH, just post your ETH address in this Gitter channel : https://gitter.im/kovan-testnet/faucet
* To acquire Kovan FND, for now just ask us in our telegram channel : https://t.me/fundrequestofficial

### Start application
You have 2 options to start the application. If you didn't work with maven/spring boot in the past, you can use the quick setup.
If you have experience, please go to the import guide below.

#### Quick
To run the application, execute:
1. `build.sh` on Linux/Mac and  `build.bat` on Windows. This script will build the entire project, if you make any changes, rerun this script. Building the first time will take a bit longer.
2. `runPlatform.sh` on Linux/Mac and  `runPlatform.bat`. This will run the platform, when rebuilding stop this script first.
3. `runAdmin.sh` on Linux/Mac and  `runAdmin.bat`. This will run the admin panel, when rebuilding stop this script first.



#### Import
The application is a standard maven / spring boot setup. For local development you have to start the application 
with the spring profile `local`. 
You can import the entire project using your favourite IDE.

To start the **platform**, you can run the java class:
```
io.fundreqest.platform.tweb.WebApplication.java
```

To start the **admin panel**, you can run the java class:
```
io.fundrequest.platform.admin.AdminApplication.java
```
